                - Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift): Minor optimizations
                - Refactor/Re-architect: Redesign for cloud-native benefits
                - Repurchase: Move to SaaS solutions
                - Retain: Keep on-premises for now

                Cloud Migration Considerations for Startups:
                
                1. Budget Constraints and Cost Management:
                - Start with free tiers and credits from cloud providers
                - Use auto-scaling to avoid over-provisioning
                - Implement cost monitoring and alerts from day one
                - Consider spot/preemptible instances for development environments
                - Plan for growth but avoid premature optimization
                
                2. Limited Technical Resources:
                - Prioritize managed services over self-managed infrastructure
                - Use Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings when possible
                - Leverage cloud provider support and documentation
                - Consider hiring cloud consultants for critical decisions
                - Invest in team training and certification
                
                3. Rapid Scaling Requirements:
                - Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
                - Use containerization for consistent deployments
                - Implement CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration
                - Choose services that can scale automatically
                - Plan database architecture for growth
                
                4. Time to Market Pressure:
                - Use cloud-native services to accelerate development
                - Leverage existing solutions (SaaS) where possible
                - Focus on core business logic, not infrastructure
                - Use infrastructure-as-code for reproducible deployments
                - Implement monitoring and observability early
                
                5. Compliance and Security on a Budget:
                - Use cloud provider security tools and best practices
                - Implement security by design, not as an afterthought
                - Leverage compliance certifications from cloud providers
                - Use managed identity and access management services
                - Regular security audits and penetration testing
                
                6. Technology Stack Decisions:
                - Choose technologies with strong cloud support
                - Consider serverless architectures for cost efficiency
                - Use microservices for scalability and team autonomy
                - Implement proper logging and monitoring
                - Plan for disaster recovery and business continuity

                Cloud Cost Optimization Strategies:
                
                1. Right-Sizing Resources:
                - Monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization
                - Use cloud provider recommendations for instance sizing
                - Implement auto-scaling to match demand
                - Regular review and adjustment of resource allocations
                - Consider burstable instances for variable workloads
                
                2. Storage Optimization:
                - Use appropriate storage classes (hot, cool, archive)
                - Implement lifecycle policies for automatic tiering
                - Compress and deduplicate data where possible
                - Regular cleanup of unused snapshots and backups
                - Use block storage only when necessary
                
                3. Network Cost Management:
                - Minimize data transfer between regions
                - Use content delivery networks (CDNs) for global content
                - Implement data compression for transfers
                - Choose regions strategically based on user location
                - Use private networks for internal communication
                
                4. Reserved Capacity and Commitments:
                - Purchase reserved instances for predictable workloads
                - Use savings plans for flexible compute commitments
                - Analyze usage patterns before making commitments
                - Consider convertible reservations for flexibility
                - Monitor and optimize reservation utilization
                
                5. Serverless and Managed Services:
                - Use serverless functions for event-driven workloads
                - Leverage managed databases to reduce operational overhead
                - Implement auto-scaling for managed services
                - Use managed container services for orchestration
                - Consider serverless data processing for batch jobs
                
                6. Cost Monitoring and Governance:
                - Implement cost allocation tags for chargeback
                - Set up budget alerts and spending limits
                - Regular cost reviews and optimization sessions
                - Use cost management tools and dashboards
                - Establish cost optimization as part of development process
