## How Recommendations Work

### Data Collection

The recommendation engine analyzes:
- **Workload Requirements**: Compute, storage, database needs
- **Performance Requirements**: Latency, availability, DR needs
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory frameworks, certifications
- **Budget Constraints**: Current costs, target costs, optimization priority
- **Technical Requirements**: Required services, ML/AI, analytics
- **Current Infrastructure**: On-premises, cloud, hybrid

### Evaluation Process

For each cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), the system:

1. **Service Matching**: Compares required services to provider offerings
2. **Cost Estimation**: Predicts monthly costs based on workload profiles
3. **Compliance Evaluation**: Matches compliance requirements to certifications
4. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates capability to meet performance needs
5. **Migration Complexity**: Assesses difficulty of migration from current state

### Scoring Algorithm

The final score is a weighted combination of five factors:

```
Overall Score = (Service × 0.30) + (Cost × 0.25) + (Compliance × 0.20) + 
                (Performance × 0.15) + (Migration × 0.10)
```

**Default Weights**:
- Service Availability: 30%
- Pricing: 25%
- Compliance: 20%
- Technical Fit: 15%
- Migration Complexity: 10%

You can adjust these weights based on your priorities.

## Scoring Methodology

### Service Availability Score (0-1)

Measures how well the provider's service catalog matches your requirements.

**Calculation**:
```
Service Score = (Matched Services / Required Services) × Service Quality Factor
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Exact Matches**: Provider has the exact service you need (1.0)
- **Equivalent Services**: Provider has similar service (0.8)
- **Workarounds**: Service can be built using other services (0.5)
- **Not Available**: Service doesn't exist (0.0)

**Example**:
```
Required Services: [compute, storage, managed-database, ml-training, serverless]

AWS:
- compute: EC2 (exact match) = 1.0
- storage: S3 (exact match) = 1.0
- managed-database: RDS (exact match) = 1.0
- ml-training: SageMaker (exact match) = 1.0
- serverless: Lambda (exact match) = 1.0
Service Score = (5/5) × 1.0 = 1.0

GCP:
- compute: Compute Engine (exact match) = 1.0
- storage: Cloud Storage (exact match) = 1.0
- managed-database: Cloud SQL (exact match) = 1.0
- ml-training: Vertex AI (exact match) = 1.0
- serverless: Cloud Functions (exact match) = 1.0
Service Score = (5/5) × 1.0 = 1.0
```

**Interpretation**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent service coverage
- **0.7-0.9**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Adequate coverage, some workarounds needed
- **<0.5**: Poor coverage, significant gaps

### Pricing Score (0-1)

Evaluates cost-effectiveness for your specific workloads.

**Calculation**:
```
Cost Score = 1 - (Estimated Cost - Target Cost) / Target Cost
```

Normalized to 0-1 range with adjustments for:
- Volume discounts
- Reserved instance savings
- Spot/preemptible instance availability
- Data transfer costs
- Support costs

**Example**:
```
Target Monthly Budget: $50,000

AWS Estimate: $48,500
Cost Score = 1 - (48,500 - 50,000) / 50,000 = 1.03 → capped at 1.0

GCP Estimate: $42,000
Cost Score = 1 - (42,000 - 50,000) / 50,000 = 1.16 → capped at 1.0

Azure Estimate: $52,000
Cost Score = 1 - (52,000 - 50,000) / 50,000 = 0.96
```

**Interpretation**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Within or under budget
- **0.7-0.9**: Slightly over budget (5-15%)
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderately over budget (15-30%)
- **<0.5**: Significantly over budget (>30%)

### Compliance Score (0-1)

Measures how well the provider meets your compliance requirements.

**Calculation**:
```
Compliance Score = (Met Requirements / Total Requirements) × Certification Quality
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Direct Certifications**: Provider has the exact certification (1.0)
- **Equivalent Certifications**: Similar but not exact (0.8)
- **Partial Coverage**: Some but not all requirements met (0.5)
- **Not Certified**: No relevant certifications (0.0)

**Example**:
```
Required Compliance: [GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001]

AWS:
- GDPR: Compliant (1.0)
- HIPAA: BAA available (1.0)
- SOC2: Type II certified (1.0)
- ISO27001: Certified (1.0)
Compliance Score = (4/4) × 1.0 = 1.0

GCP:
- GDPR: Compliant (1.0)
- HIPAA: BAA available (1.0)
- SOC2: Type II certified (1.0)
- ISO27001: Certified (1.0)
Compliance Score = (4/4) × 1.0 = 1.0

Azure:
- GDPR: Compliant (1.0)
- HIPAA: BAA available (1.0)
- SOC2: Type II certified (1.0)
- ISO27001: Certified (1.0)
Compliance Score = (4/4) × 1.0 = 1.0
```

**Interpretation**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Fully compliant
- **0.7-0.9**: Mostly compliant, minor gaps
- **0.5-0.7**: Partially compliant, significant gaps
- **<0.5**: Non-compliant, major gaps
